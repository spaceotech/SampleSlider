# SampleSlider

Sliders are one of the great ways to allow your app users to set values in your iOS apps. And, to add such sliders, an iOS UI Slider object is used to select single value from a slider. Here, I’ve a created a demo on [How to Implement UI Slider For Adding Custom Slider in Your Next iPhone App](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/implement-ui-slider-example-tutorial/). 

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your iOS App and looking to [Hire iPhone App Developer](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-iphone-developer/ ) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
